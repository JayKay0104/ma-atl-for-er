NOTE:*******************************************************************************************************************************************
All the files here are only to understand how the final candiate sets (training sets) got created, which serve as the basis for all experiments.
They do not need to be executed, as the execution is very time consuming and huge files get created.

The notebooks Books_CreatePotentialCorrespondences_*.ipynb enable to run different settings for string similarity joins for each combination
and evaluate them based on Pairs Completeness (PC) and Reduction Ratio (RR).

The notebook CreatingFeatureVectorsOfPotCorr.ipynb first performs filtering (one can adapt the settings as desired) and then calculates the 
feature vector for each pair (the pot. correspondences that were output by the filtering.
The resulting feature vectors (or everything that get stored) are the inputs for the candiate set creatin algorithm.
