Train and test sets are taken from https://github.com/aprimpeli/UnsupervisedBootAL/tree/61c629e6ec571424cd0a6171a2471a4e5ad97f46/datasets/author
Nothing was changed at the split, but the features from the atl_for_er setting are created on them.
The features are already rescaled so that all features are similarity measures in the range of [0,1].
